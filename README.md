# Upstream_Flashflood_Monitoring_System
An IoT-based real-time system for flash flood and landslide prediction. Combines ESP32 sensing nodes, LoRa communication, and a Raspberry Pi base station running a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) for intelligent flood detection in upstream areas.

This project is a real-time flood and landslide monitoring system that uses an ESP32 NodeMCU to collect environmental data from sensors measuring rainfall, water level (ultrasonic), water flow rate, and wind speed (anemometer). The data is transmitted wirelessly to a Raspberry Pi 4 base station using LoRa SX1278 modules. At the base station, a lightweight Spiking Neural Network (SNN) processes the incoming data to predict potential flash flood events. The system follows a streamlined architecture: Sensors → ESP32 → LoRa SX1278 → Raspberry Pi 4 → SNN Model → Prediction Output. Built using technologies like Python, LoRa communication, and SNN models, this solution supports low-power remote sensing, real-time data transfer, and on-device intelligent flood prediction. It is highly modular and can be expanded or customized for different deployment scenarios. The system is ideal for flash flood monitoring and remote environmental sensing in vulnerable regions.
